Patient: turti tri

In this text based adventure you take control of a person who wakes up in an empty hospital without knowing anything
abut how he got there, or who he is. For some reason his mind is only filled with the number 33. The hospital contains some
useful items that may possibly help you get closer to your escape, and towards an explanation about your past.

There are various commands you can use that enable you to interact with the surroundings:

1. The command "go" followed by a cardinal direction allows you to move around the map
2. The command "look" allows you to observe the room you are in and notice items of interest
3. The command "take" allows you to pick up certain items
4. The command "use" allows you to access the function of an item that you have in your inventory
